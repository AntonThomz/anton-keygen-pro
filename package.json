  "features": {
    "randomized-keys": "Generates completely random keys consisting of uppercase letters and numbers, ensuring uniqueness in each instance.",
    "segmented-format": "Outputs the key in a structured format, divided into four segments (e.g., ABCD-1234-EFGH-5678) with each segment containing 4 characters.",
    "lowercase-conversion": "Returns the key in all lowercase format for consistent styling and easy integration into systems requiring lowercase input.",
    "cryptographic-security": "Utilizes Node.js's 'crypto' module for secure random byte generation, ensuring high levels of randomness.",
    "customizable": "Can be easily extended to modify the length of segments, the number of segments, or the character set used."

  "design": {
    "simplicity": "Designed to be lightweight, the package offers an easy-to-use API with a single exported function, allowing developers to quickly integrate the functionality.",
    "modularity": "The package is designed with extensibility in mind, enabling developers to adjust or enhance key generation behavior according to their needs.",
    "reliability": "Leveraging native Node.js modules, this package ensures reliable performance and randomness even in high-scale applications."
